Amidst the hype and grand visions put forward by some, there&#8217;s a company that&#8217;s taking a different, more subtle approach &#8211; Futureverse. While the metaverse has been associated with virtual worlds like Decentraland or Second Life, Futureverse sees it as a collection of interoperable applications built on top of user data. Their goal is to create seamless and immersive experiences without drawing attention to the underlying technology.The Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has been vocal about his ambitious plan to create an interconnected virtual world where people can work, socialize, and play. Zuckerberg envisions a metaverse that blurs the lines between physical and digital realities, providing a seamless and immersive experience for billions of users worldwide.Zuckerberg believes that the metaverse has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet and with each other. He believes that it will create new opportunities for work, education, entertainment, and social connection.However, Zuckerberg&#8217;s vision for the metaverse has been met with endless skepticism. Some critics have argued that the metaverse is just a buzzword and that it is unlikely to ever live up to its hype. Others have raised concerns about the potential privacy and security risks associated with the metaverse.While the vision of the Facebook CEO captures the imaginations of many and dominates the headlines, Futureverse is approaching the metaverse with a different perspective, emphasizing subtlety and universality.Futureverse has recently made headlines with its successful $54 million Series A funding round. The startup comprises 11 companies spanning various sectors, from gaming studios to web3 payment facilitators and blockchain startups. However, their focus isn&#8217;t solely on building a virtual world but rather on powering a wide range of experiences. Aaron McDonald, co-founder, and CEO of Futureverse, believes that some of the prevailing misconceptions about the metaverse stem from an overemphasis on the virtual world aspect. He asserts:Futureverse defines the metaverse as the collection of interoperable applications built on top of user data.The company&#8217;s vision is to create applications that seamlessly integrate with users&#8217; lives, making the technology behind it nearly invisible. McDonald draws parallels with AI companies that focus on problem-solving rather than being labeled as AI-centric, and remote work startups that facilitate work without being solely remote-focused. Regarding the company&#8217;s mission, McDonald&#8217;s adds:Our mission is to make the technology invisible.Futureverse&#8217;s approach is to provide immersive experiences without highlighting the use of blockchain or NFT technology. For example, they collaborated with FIFA during the Women&#8217;s World Cup to create a game where users can coach a team of automated players without being aware of the underlying web3 and NFTs. The goal is to make the technology invisible to users and focus on enjoyable experiences.Despite the challenges of operating in a stigmatized sector without a universally agreed definition of the metaverse, Futureverse has garnered support from investors who understand the company&#8217;s vision. Seeking out investors like 10T Holdings, who comprehend the true potential of the metaverse beyond the buzz, has been critical to Futureverse&#8217;s growth.Shara Senderoff, co-founder of Futureverse, acknowledges the industry&#8217;s struggles with stigma and assumptions due to the influence of more vocal players. However, with partnerships with prestigious brands like FIFA and F1, Futureverse aims to attract clients who value the experiences created by the brands rather than being fixated on the underlying technology.Futureverse&#8217;s perspective on the metaverse highlights that we are already encountering it in different ways. McDonald emphasizes the concept of &#8220;immersive convergence,&#8221; where the separation between various user experiences is diminishing, leading to a more cohesive digital environment.McDonald stated:When is the metaverse coming? We are in it. You are in the metaverse; it is not something that is coming. We&#8217;ve observed early progress on the idea of immersive convergence, breaking down the division between different user experiences into a unified oneWhile the concept of the metaverse continues to evolve and spark debate, Futureverse&#8217;s approach holds promise. By prioritizing seamless experiences over showcasing complex technology, the company aims to shape a more subtle, user-centric metaverse.Futureverse&#8217;s partnerships with influential brands like FIFA and F1 demonstrate the potential appeal of their approach to a wider audience.As the tech industry moves forward with its pursuit of the metaverse, it&#8217;s essential to consider diverse visions and approaches. While Zuckerberg&#8217;s grand vision may capture attention, companies like Futureverse remind us that the metaverse&#8217;s future is full of possibilities. It involves a blend of subtle technology and immersive experiences waiting to be explored.

Recent examples include the extraordinary knowledge explosion via the invention of the printing press when horse-riding was replaced by the automobile, peaceful living turned into World-wars, or our world turned upside down via the Internet. Later the same world flew out of the window via smart phones.Triangulation of three catastrophic monstrosities approaching fast will bifurcate the world into two halves,&#160; the &#8220;old school world order, the 4th Industrial Revolution and seek and destroy doctrine&#8221; against the &#8220;new school of First Industrial Revolution of Mind, National Mobilization o Entrepreneurialism to uplift SME sectors to open globalization on real value creation, fair trade models.&#8221; A new world cometh, a new understanding of mindsets arrives, and new global age suddenly becomes the new reality.&#160;Futurism demands futuristic literacy; nevertheless, studying the world a decade before the arrival of the Internet or horse riding culture before the automobile is an introductory study. Moses never had a mobile phone, but what if he had, or if we still needed to develop one? The phone did not fall from the sky, but a remarkable person arrived first; the rest is history&#8212;monster global trends are human-made evolutionary changes for humankind to advance. Henceforth, new thinking is not only offensive when transformed into change brutality. The future opens to open minds.FIRST: Human Intelligence Collides With Artificial Intelligence.A global scale test of human endurance against machines is already in motion here; the combined human wisdom cascaded over millennia, exercised millions of cultural fragments and billions of incidents of extraordinary human endeavor, now facing an artificial act of artificial ignorance, wrapped as artificial intelligence, during last couple of decades for an all-out front stage open war. No need to book a front seat; you are already sitting on the stage. This monster will strangle you where ever you are and whatever you do.Nevertheless, this entire circus is packaged like a &#8216;Pet-Rock&#8217; in a gift box, a rock placed inside to be fed and cared for like a personal pet. Study the sixties, the era of nonsensical marketing gimmicks. However, this can become extremely dangerous and possibly a nightmarish scenario.To understand levels of &#8216;intelligence&#8217; the levels of &#8216;stupidity&#8217; must be identified.&#160;The Stupidification of artificiality; Like a wide-open canyon still unable to fathom the knowledge gap of the populace, it is wide open enough not to realize that AI is neither a runaway train chasing its agenda, but rather, exceptional programmers in caboose managing the entire railway systems. On the other hand, AI as brilliant programming can contribute immensely to global societies, but &#8216;fake pretended intelligence&#8217; against natural human intelligence only makes it the largest destructive force and con-game on humankind.Hollywoodism school of global mind management, in its traditional and make-believe style of cinematography, plays tricks with human minds and unexposed naivety and rewrites history to create selective narratives. There is neither, nor ever any human intelligence of any type in any machines whatsoever. It is all about boasting brilliant programming, superior human-made software, and engineering.Today, the populace is convinced that soon the arrival of the sniper dog battalion managing riots will be AI smart enough to target and shoot the undesirables. The illusionists are now propagating the powers of AI as emotionally thinking robots with a soft touch and merciful killings, along with the dangers of the runway radicals on hunting sprees and serial killing.Hate-Wars: Anticipated to lead a glamorous arrival of Digital Rapture with its eschatology to rewrite all religions and create global hate wars, selected city-by-city, and house-by-house. ChatGPT and its 100 off-springs all lined up in a 24x7x365 format under constant programming on a worldwide scale experiment to shake down humankind&#8217;s intelligence. The bifurcations of pro-AI and anti-AI will either allow full acceptance and surrender to AI as a new techno-religion or smarten up and seek the First Industrial Revolution of Mind, which must replace the long-awaited and persistently absent Fourth Industrial Revolution.Digital-Anarchy will create Digital Rapture:&#160; When hyper Digital world is declared as AI-Centric-Halloween parties overtake civility, running like a 27x7x365 hunt as a macabre festival where dawn and sunsets, dead and alive, human and animal, are all the same, running in chaos in a lawless cyber frontier worldwide. Billion customized narratives with hoax illustrations, false facts, and fake impersonating videos in unimaginable poses and situations, drenched in damaging hate exploitation to witness the rise of anarchy where the only consolation remains: Rapture, as a final note on eschatology. AI will bend humankind in real time to collapse into Fraud, the 8th Circle of Dante&#8217;s InfernoIs Dante alive? Suddenly asks humankind, yes, now everybody is a Dante, replies AI. Is this hell or heaven? Yells humankind, again. Yes, booth, in the same place, double-feature, for half the price, AI whispers and smiles wickedly,Be prepared mentally and be ready physically. Unless running a rehab center, those needing daily motivation will require regimented and well-balanced learning to advance personal and economic development. The future demands futuristic literacy, proven performances, and global age understandings.SECOND: The Economic Thought Clashes with Entrepreneurial IntellectualismCivilization progressed just fine before the advent of the school of economic thought. Last century, the significant contribution of economic thinking was primarily to invent unique and advanced instruments to serve special agenda for special interests and create forensic catalogs to sustain control on economic thought as the only supremacy of innovative mathematics left to generate debt and triple-hedged economies, printing currencies, and declaring all this great success.&#160;Is this the fancy economic footwork and mathematical witchcraft which created globalization and brought half the world to its knees? Is this what systematically destroyed the middle classes? Was this the creation of the information age, service economy, or crypto-tyrannies, with unique tax heavens and unlimited debt ceilings? Humankind can do better without such mathematical intellectualism and return to actual hardcore value creation and entrepreneurialism, happy to pay fair taxes.Henceforth, the most significant error of economic thinking is the clash between mathematical equations where entrepreneurialism is way out of the league of the economic intelligentsia. For example, we already have one million organizations created by entrepreneurs, each creating a million jobs. Do we have at least one Nobel Prize winner economist who created one such organization? Study, a brief history of small and medium enterprises of the worldOn the eve of the last global financial collapse, the world&#8217;s economists were happy-go-lucky as all was going normal and oblivious to the 3 AM panic calls on economic collapse to the White House. Numbering games are only numbering games. They, at best, create smoke and screens but not real value creation, which is a by-product of an entrepreneurial mindset on productivity, performance, and profitability. Study more on Google.Openly challenged and openly debated. Economic development without entrepreneurialism is economic destruction. There is no political power without economic power. There is no economic power without entrepreneurial power. There is no entrepreneurial power unless the mindset hypothesis is balanced. The mindset hypothesis creates a balance between the job seeker and job creator mindsets. No further proof is required:Increasing the debt ceilings are not economic successes but a grand failures. At the risk of never getting nominated for the Nobel Prize in Economics, here is a dark fact; an economy solely based on measuring value manipulation as economic success is nothing but a public fraud for ignoring value creation as the accurate measurement of the only fundamental components of economic success. What is new thinking of SME sectors?Challenging the current visible economic failures, here is the global-age answer with new economic thinking for some very offensive narrative for being a brand new thought; change is always fought to the end. This is an authoritative, entrepreneurial response based on already continuous historical successes and real hidden values created by the national mobilization of SMEs in the USA, CHINA, India, and dozens more.Multilateralism and Blocs are on the rise; BRICS, OIC, African Union, Commonwealth, and ASEAN, plus others, across the free economies, political leadership underestimated the rise of broader knowledge acquired amongst the global populace and overestimated the role of education. In contrast, bureaucracies grossly underestimated the powers of digitization and overestimated their productivity. Observe the rise of Africa and its role on global stage.The greatest error of economic thinking was always treating an SME as small, like calling a baby elephant too small proves an evident lack of zoology knowledge. Entrepreneurial mysticism drives a tiny little enterprise into a global giant. The biggest challenges are hidden in this need to understand the national mobilization of entrepreneurialism within economic development. Furthermore, a need to know how fast the population-rich nations are taking over the knowledge-rich nations is where the next decade will carve the world&#8217;s economic powers.Nevertheless, failing to understand the &#8216;mindset hypothesis, &#8216;the difference between the job seeker and job creator mindsets is the first step to getting eliminated from any serious dialogue on the subject of SME economic recovery. Failing to articulate the &#8216;national mobilization of entrepreneurialism&#8217; is the second step to getting eliminated from any economic development activity as a whole. More on GoogleChasing access to finance or Fintech is like acupuncture on a dead body unless entrepreneurialism is present as a prime circulation artery, throbbing and pulsating; only a real live economy is entrepreneurial because a solely numerically-run economy is already a dead economy, like a postmortem without any plans to win a gold medal with a motionless body.Challenged are the free economies of the world, separated are entrepreneurial economies, and isolated are the ones who need help deciphering how the national mobilization of SME entrepreneurialism will uplift grassroots prosperity and save nations from economic collapse. Although the world is already on the precipice of some grand-scale economic collapse if it ever survives the lingering financial technocalamaties, it is already transforming to entirely different models of economic thinking and new structuring of city models with unique styles and new definitions of work.&#160;The next global financial crisis should be enough to prove that economics is a significant mathematical exercise at best as forensic and has no place for job seekers&#8217; mindsets to create real value creation unless balanced with job creators&#8217; mindsets.Large-scale solutions: What would happen if all the skyscrapers were developed by highly qualified architects with great ideas, sketches, and rendering but critically lacking hardcore experiences of erecting skyscrapers without construction builders with solid skills and mastery of building codes? What would happen if half the skyscraper collapsed? What would happen to the art and science of architecture driving the city skylines with half of the buildings with smashed towers? How long would this go on, and what level of up-skilling demands be placed on such discipline and city planning? How has the world transformed with constant economic failures and mathematical catalogs of schemes? Good architecture around the world is based on architecture parallel with construction skills. Combining job seekers with job creators is the best model for achieving economic development. Solely in the hands of job seekers, and economic mindsets, economic development without entrepreneurialism is economic destruction. Study more on Google.No proof is required, as a single week of quick audit and testing of any government department of finance and economy or SME, across any nation speaks volumes on such critical discrepancies.Here are the five difficult test questions; if they ever created a small or medium enterprise and made it a worthwhile business success? If they can articulate why simple ordinary people start odd crazy SMEs out of the blue, why, when, and how they turn into national or global giants and their hidden motivations. What are authoritative enough narratives to create a qualified economic development model if they can articulate anything about authentic and generic entrepreneurialism? If they can explain if they recognize and happen to be job seeker mindset and how and why they differentiate from the job creator mindset, what positive charge it will create when combined. Such questions will boost productivity and bring clarity to economic development.THIRD: Downtown Cities Lose to Downtown-Less CitiesMonster trends redefine our surroundings, erode century-old traditions and perceptions, and alter our thinking. Built over centuries, the image supremacy of any city was always its downtown, nurtured over centuries, modified, updated, and constantly modernized as art and rewarded as an exclusive real estate at 100% to 1000% premium priced over standard city space. Historically, it worked wonders, relating to the central part or main business centers and high-class commercial areas with residential and entertainment sections of any small town or megacity.Office towers provided the skyline. Neon signage at the top of the skyscrapers provided the image supremacy to the name identity. The sparkling skyline provided the collateral to attract traffic and tourism to the city. Businesses only rested once they acquired the best downtown spot to boost their profile for the stock markets and impress the marketplace. This process repeated across the world during the last century. The iconic buildings, amazing head offices, and across the developed world, they received billion-plus commuters inside the downtown limits and, after a full day of cubicle slavery, left at the end of the day to go home, sleep early and start all over to commute the next day.The slender, glossy vertical prisons of corporate bureaucracy once dominated the economic and political powers of the world, now with the advent of Zoomerang virtual culture, half-empty, gasping for more pollution to survive. The commute of billion-plus cars causing critical damage to climate is now starting to end.Behold the &#8216;industrial age&#8217; and how it was developed by cheap and hard labor; now notice how smart and fluid minds provide wings to uplift the &#8216;digital age&#8217; worldwide. The free world&#8217;s economies desperately need a quick immersion in the fundamental differences between the two; the &#8216;physicality of work&#8217; and the &#8216;mentality of performance.&#8217; How will this new math drive human productivity, affecting performance and profitability? Why will this art save national economies?HR ignored the inhuman issues of cubicle slavery under the billion-car-rat-race of gas-guzzling frenzy. No matter how remote, office-less productivity demands new measurements of value creation either delivered via rested minds or already exhausted water-cooler-huggers or mad-max-survivors.Recommendations: Why will city planners hesitate to accept such realities openly? Why will they not take future issues on the &#8216;physicality of work&#8217; and cope with the &#8216;mentality of performance&#8217;? After all, this is a new shift and a new divide in the workforce. The gold watches for 50 years of service culture are now for old classic movies. The executive washroom keys lost their powers. The floors, clocks, and calendars have lost meaning as the 24x7x364 free flew productivity culture is rising. Public and private organizations need new HR thinking to restructure virtual organizations to dance in virtual economics and skate on global digital platforms.A Downtown-Less City Model: We were at this crossroads over a century ago; the horse&#8217;s replacement completed the invention of the car. The horse was not supposed to pull the car&#8217;s body, while the engine was not supposed to pull the carriage. Likewise, smart offices need smart minds working in digital space within the digital world. Offices with bodies moving around are now only gatherings of the old models.The small and medium enterprises were barred from downtown clusters of towers, but for a good reason; lack of luxury dollars. However, a well-planned program for SMEs may be a hidden option. Small and medium enterprises with high potential may become free tenets when they reach a point of maturity and become rent-paying tenants. This rent creation mechanism will create the &#8216;grand central hubs&#8217; of innovative incubation centers for creative innovations and give downtowns a new look. Today, another option is occupying such empty towers for people experiencing homelessness.For the last decades, almost all senior, middle, and lower management made billions of trips to downtowns of the free world daily. They paid the most expensive parking, ate day-old sandwiches, and shrugged around water coolers as a private cultural outing. Bound, gagged and chained to their cubicles, they daydreamed of liberation. As a result, the workers suffered immensely, inhaling pollution on the way in and again on the way out while immersed in nonsensical meetings of inconsequential order. As a result, the downtown corporate bureaucracies started breaking apart a decade before the Pandemic.Visible every night around the free world, the once sparkling downtown oozing vibrancy now lay low as dimly lit clusters of ghost towers. Written on the wall decades before the Pandemic, the futurism already declared as &#8216;work-less,&#8217; &#8216;office-less,&#8217; and &#8216;job-less&#8217; while the downtown real-estate politics in denial took a different approach. The power of urbanization is to the test here.Propagation of this new virtualization of economic models eliminates office towers, removes the centrality and supremacy of downtown, and questions their role as the most significant contributors to pollution. Nevertheless, further exploration of such thinking also destroys the meaning of modern business education and its values and powers, if any. The new change is unique. That is why it is a very different change and highly offensive to old thinking. While the pending crisis is real, testing options are about staying close to reality, as the rest is only lingering fakery.The Re-Immigration Factor:Immigrants helped and developed the Western World; they will now move to their homelands and build already invigorating countries. Long-term immigration created a highly influential workforce for developing nations. The need for advanced skills will become visible problems for developed nations. The rainfall of technologies will make micro-power-nations become highly streamlined productive economies. The sharp decline in quality of life and hate toward immigrants will be the main driving force. Observe the first noticeable rise in Asia as millions of highly qualified immigrants suddenly returned to their homelands for fierce scrutiny, checkpoint behavior, and treatment across the USA and developed nations and openly declared potential terrorists in 2001. Notice how the adjustment and rise became a super boom to local cities and villages, and a new phase started.&#160;&#160;The monster: downtowns of the developed nations force a billion plus to enter the city core, the most expansive section, sucking up energy and costs, reducing productivity, and later exiting every day to long commutes home, once again causing climate damage and wasted time. This slavery should have ended a decade ago. Covid provided the kick. Global rains of free technologies deliver all the solutions and communication technologies to outperform while remote in preferred habitats with 24x7x365 predetermined hours.This is potentially a grave dystopian scene that could spread across Western nations, a grand reality still in deep silence, unspoken debates, and hush for the final arrival of new thinking.The Monstrous Triangulation:Artificial ignorance will strike, impersonating intelligence and disrupting society like nothing ever in the past disturbs the inner sanctum of humankind. Digital narrative with maximum personalized data will further weaponize the fakery. Having lost the credibility of institutions, the global populace will take a restless approach to constant economic failures and fight out the doctrine of seek and destroy&#8212;national mobilization of entrepreneurialism to rebuild national citizenry will open new national debates. The climate change debates, circular economy, or ESG mandates are all economic issues seeking meritocracy and entrepreneurialism. The collapsing downtown will provide a new frontier of the first industrial revolution of mind and remote working, plus uplifting of SMEs, a new vitality for the nation.The destructive forces will force new changes in real-time&#8212;a massive difference from previous slow-moving trends. , fight for survival, and ideological differences combined by balancing mindsets with job seekers with job creators to make extraordinary progress. Emergence of new thinking will outsmart stagnation, diversity and tolerance will emerge.Expothon narrative:&#160; Henry Ford neither invented the tire nor the car engine; he created the Assembly line. Expothon neither created the SME nor the exportability. It began advanced thinking on &#8216;national mobilization of entrepreneurialism&#8217; as a highly streamlined, 24x7x365 simultaneous synchronization of the largest but most ignored national asset, now, a decade later, gaining global attention. Expothon has been sharing information weekly with some 2000 senior officials at the Cabinet level around 100 countries for the last 50 -100 weeks. Mastery of new entrepreneurial economic thinking is a new revolution on SME Mobilization. A global high level, virtual event series will further advance the agenda, debate and clarify and table turnkey mobilization options in the coming months.

In many respects this is set to be one of the most significant BRICS summits in the past decade as the BRICS+ outreach re-launched by China in 2022 has generated a massive reaction from the Global South that now sees BRICS+ as a key platform for realizing their potential on the international arena. Whatever form it takes, the coming BRICS expansion may generate further changes in the structure of international economic alliances, while also broadening the possibilities for emerging markets to mobilize financing for the attainment of their key development goals.With respect to the composition of the new entrants into the core BRICS grouping there were a number of possible modalities proposed, including all of the non-BRICS G20 developing economies as well as a number of other key regional players from the Global South. Among the possible formations for this new stage of BRICS expansion I earlier advanced the BEAMS and PEAKS concepts, though recent developments have rendered these exact formats less likely in view of the preferences expressed by BRICS core members. In case the new wave of entrants were to consist of the five G20 members that are as of yet outside of BRICS &#8211; Argentina, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia &#8211; plus the two developing economies with the next largest nominal GDP in PPP terms &#8211; Egypt and Iran &#8211; the resulting new wave of BRICS can be termed as AMITIES, with all of these economies having participated in the BRICS+ format in the period between 2017 and 2022. Such a formation apart from bringing some of the largest emerging economies also has the benefit of additional representation accorded to Latin America and Africa, while raising the scope for greater policy coordination in major international organizations. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And while the exact composition of the expanded BRICS/BRICS+ formation will likely be the most sought-after theme at the upcoming summit, no less important will be the impact that this expansion will have on the existing patterns of alliances and economic policy options faced by emerging markets. With respect to the latter, several trends may be observed as BRICS expansion gains momentum and a more diverse and multipolar economic framework sets in:In effect, this is a different setting characterized by broader possibilities and options that become open to emerging market economies. This effect is further strengthened by the widening possibilities of building new patterns of economic alliances that may prioritize the creation of new sectoral platforms as well as regional and cross-regional blocks. One of the likely trends in the creation of such new alliances is their greater concentration within the Global South, though the developed world could well take the lead in some of the key areas of the global economy, including possibly in the formation of the so-called digital economic agreements (DEAs). Another area where the Western world could play a leading role in a new multipolar setting is in the sphere of &#8220;integration of integrations&#8221;, whereby the EU as the most advanced regional block could lead the formation of an inclusive global platform for regional trade blocks.As for the next wave of BRICS entrants, their accession into the BRICS+ circle will widen the array of possible options, including continued development of economic relations with members of the G7. In fact, the possibilities for the expanded BRICS block that includes the likes of Turkey, Argentina, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, to explore the modalities of building communication lines with the advanced economies could be enhanced. In this respect, a BRICS++ framework of economic cooperation with the development institutions from advanced economies could become one of the themes on the agenda of an expanded BRICS formation. Modalities such as BRICS+AMITIES that bring together all developing economies that are G20 members may enhance the possibilities for building more structured and coordinated policies in key international fora such as G20 and the Bretton Woods institutions. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet another possibility is for the new BRICS entrants/BRICS+ economies to explore new formats and new priorities for economic alliances coming from the Global South. For example, rather than prioritizing high economic growth and higher market returns as did the original BRIC vision, there may be scope to place the emphasis on sustainability &#8211; not only in terms of environmental standards, or the growth vs balanced development, but also in terms of global economic governance and the role that middle-income economies play in a multipolar global economy setting.According to the World Bank, more than half of the economies in the world economy are middle-income countries (MICs)[1], furthermore middle income economies account for &#8220;75% of the world&#8217;s population and 62% of the world&#8217;s poor&#8230; MICs also represent about&#160;one-third of global GDP&#160;and are major engines of global growth&#8221;. With such credentials, the expanded BRICS (that is largely concentrated in the middle-income space) could position itself as a key center of gravity in the world economy that not only accounts for the majority of the population and the number of countries, but also for moderation in economic contradictions and frictions as well as greater sustainability in economic development &#8211; much as the middle-class performs such a stabilizing role in national economies.Going forward, with the progression in the multipolarity of the world economy, the role of the middle-income economies is likely to grow in line with how the median voter theory operates in a democratic electoral setting. And this greater importance of BRICS+ together with catch-up growth vis-&#224;-vis the developed world will call for further changes in the governance of the global economy. The Tocqueville paradox formulated nearly 200 years ago &#8211; namely that rising affluence raises the demand for greater equality and governance change &#8211; appears to hold not only at the country level, but also at the level of the global economy. The important point however is that while BRICS+ is becoming a platform for boosting developing countries&#8217; growth as well as for transforming the governance system of the world economy, the pattern of change favoured by BRICS is very much in the evolutionary domain, with particular emphasis placed in the block&#8217;s summit declarations on supporting multilateralism and existing multilateral institutions. Expect these principles to be reiterated yet again in the 2023 BRICS summit declaration. &#160;&#160;[1] MICs are those with a GNI per capita between $1,036 and $4,045; and upper middle-income economies &#8211; those with a GNI per capita between $4,046 and $12,535 (2021)Author&#8217;s note: first published in BRICS+ AnalyticsPublishedonByMerchant fleet of a country plays an important role to boost its economy especially earning of foreign exchange, provision food security, protection of strategic cargo especially during tension period and hostilities. Ships are floating storage which add to the national storage capacity and reduce on dependency on foreign carriers. The developed maritime nations have large merchant fleet and shipping rules attractive for investment.&#160; Now even land locked states have shipping companies. The Geneva based private ship owned company, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), in 2021-2022 earned a profit of $24 billion. It is owned principally by an Italian family which moved to Geneva as they found its laws favorable. In Pakistan, after independence the business of shipping was managed by private ship owners, who built the national fleet from scratch. The National Shipping Corporation (NSC) and Pakistan Shipping Corporation (PSC) were formed in 1960s , these had about 71 ships. After 1971, the strength reduced to 57 ships. The PNSC, a state-owned flag carrier came into existence by merger of NSC and PSC in 1979. It currently owns and operates a fleet of 11 vessels with a total tonnage of 831,711(0.832 million dead weight, DWT). These include 6 oil tankers, and 5 bulk carriers.&#160; &#160;Although the sea trade has increased over the years but hardly any merchant ship has been registered in Pakistan by the private ship owners since nationalization in 1974. In accordance with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 1964, ships of Pakistan can lift&#160; 40 percent of national cargo. This rule was incorporated to improve trade of developing countries as at that time most of the shipping lines were owned by rich countries.Pakistan&#8217;s annual trade in 2001 when the Merchant Marine Policy was promulgated was 39 million tons, and the freight bill US$ 1.5, billions while the share of the National carrier averaged 2 million tons, mere 5%.&#160; A colossal drain on the limited / depleting foreign exchange resources of the country. In 2021-22 total export / import were about 110 million tons and freight US $ 8.0 bn approx. The PNSC lifted about 10% (worth US $ 0.8bn).&#160; Pakistani ships could have lifted 40% and accrued US $3.2bn. Pakistan would have saved huge amount of foreign exchange which is need of the hour.&#160;Main objectives of the Merchant Marine Policy of 2001 which was valid till 2020 are: (i) Facilitate and attract private sector investment in shipping. (ii) Create an environment conducive for unimpeded growth of the maritime sector. (iii) Deregulate the shipping policy to provide free environment for investment in the maritime sector. (iv) Maximize sea borne trade of the country through Pakistani flag carriers. (v) Make the country&#8217;s merchant marine sector internationally competitive. (vi)&#160; Make tangible contribution to the national economy by augmenting foreign exchange earnings and reducing freight bills. It gave incentive to investors by exempting all kinds of import duties till 2020 but this policy did not prove instrumental to increase the merchant feet. Main reasons could be, short period of validity, fear of nationalization and freezing of foreign exchange accounts, inconsistency of policies concerning associated industries, and cumbersome procedures for registration of ships and subsequent sale purchase. The flag of convenience offered by most of the countries like Panama, Liberia, Marshal Island, where the investors can register the ship at much ease such as no track record of funds, nominal taxation, easy sale / purchase formalities after registration etc.&#160; Pakistani ship owners have about twelve ships registered under flag of convenience. These ships mostly carry international cargo because if these call on Pakistani ports are liable to be detained as per existing ship registration rules. It is one of the major factors which needs to be considered for shipping policy. The 2001 policy was amended in November 2019. Major points include (i) Period extended till 2030. (ii) Declaration of the Shipping Sector as a Strategic Industry (iii) Provision for the exemption of direct and indirect taxation(iv) Only Gross Registered Tonnage (GRT) based taxation with reduced rates @ US$ 0.75 annually.&#160; (v) Provision made for priority berthing to Pakistani flag vessels, (vi) No preference to PNSC in private sector cargo (vii) LNG agreements are to be on Free on Board (FOB) basis, (vii) 40 % share of PNSC in all new G2G bilateral agreements(viii) Relaxation to PNSC for entering into Joint Ventures (JVs). It is pertinent to mention that no ship has been registered even after issuance of the amendments. It obviously means that it does not give sufficient incentives and confidence to the investors and procedures for registration of ships are still cumbersome. The shipping industry is capital intensive which needs protracted policies, assurances from the government and ease of business.Keeping aforesaid in view it is proposed that (i) Long term policy of minimum 30 years with supportive financing options may be issued after threadbare deliberations with stakeholders. Because investors, banks and financial Institutions view short-lived policies as a risk. (ii) Should address ease of doing business and extending support for International Financing Institutions (iii) Like other industries e.g.&#160; agricultural, housing etc. the State Bank should allocate credit. (iv)&#160;&#160; Nationalization and freezing of foreign currency accounts&#160;&#160; be protected by Act of Parliament. (v)&#160; Like construction industry no questions are asked about source of funds for another five years for registration of ships (vi) Holding of ships by Customs, FIA and Port Authorities should be minimized because holding ship for even few hours is capital intensive. A mechanism may be devised to let go the ship on guarantees. (vii) Pakistani flag ships with 100% Pakistani crew may be given rebate on port charges, berthing priority and other associated benefits. (viii) Pakistan&#8217;s legal system does not provide swift remedies, moreover prevalent limited knowledge of maritime laws, theship owners are reluctant to venture. Therefore,dispute resolution via International Arbitration (English common law or Swiss law) must be exhausted before approaching courts for remedy. (ix) A thorough review of ships registration procedures may be done by Mercantile Marine Department (MMD) explicitly from ease of business point of view. (x) Maritime specialized personnel may be appointed on the posts like Director General Ports &amp; shipping, and MMD by giving ads in the newspapers. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(xi) Pakistani ship owners who have registered their ships under flag of convenience are allowed to register their ships in Pakistan within five years after issuance of amended policy with clear instructions that their ships will be placed under the Control of Naval Shipping Organization whenever this is activated, which is mostly done in state of emergency / hostilities. &#160;It is pertinent to mention that USA employed bulk of its merchant fleet including ships registered under flag of convenience in Gulf war. Infect merchant fleet of a country is a very vital component of Maritime Power.&#160; It is plays critical role during peace and hostilities. Pakistan needs to enlarge its merchant fleet which is the requirement for improvement of economy especially foreign exchange and to meet national &#160;emergencies.PublishedonByThe Metaverse economy is expected to generate $5 Trillion by 2030 prediction by McKinsey. The Metaverse economy refers to an emerging economic system arising from interactions between users, content creators, and businesses within the metaverse, an immersive and persistent virtual reality where individuals and entities can interact with each other in various ways, similar to the real world. The Metaverse economy includes the creation and sale of digital content, virtual transactions, metaverse-based experiences and services, virtual property, and community-based economies.The potential of the Metaverse economy represents a substantial opportunity, and several major countries already have blueprints to position themselves within the global supply chain. For instance, India aims to become a manufacturing hub for IoT devices supporting the Metaverse, such as smart glasses. China seeks to position itself as a provider of high-speed 5G and 6G internet technology, prerequisites for mass adoption of the metaverse.Indonesia, with a population of over 270 million and over 170 million internet users, has significant potential to become a center for creative content within the global Metaverse economy. Factors such as demographics, digital infrastructure readiness, the growth of the creative industry, and government support are some of the major assets that put Indonesia in a strategic position to benefit from the Metaverse phenomenon.Factors and Assets:Indonesia&#8217;s demographics are dominated by a young, creative, and digital savvy generation. They are a potent source of developers, users, and consumers of creative content. Additionally, Indonesia&#8217;s rich culture can be an endless source of inspiration for creative content creation, providing a unique touch that sets it apart from other content.Indonesia is an archipelagic nation consisting of 17,000 islands, over 1,300 tribes each with unique languages, customs, and cultures. They all have different lifestyles, histories, and traditions. There are over 700 languages spoken by various ethnic groups in Indonesia. This cultural diversity represents tangible and intangible assets that are an inexhaustible source of inspiration to support the creative industry in the era of the Metaverse economy.Indonesia&#8217;s creative industry has shown significant growth in recent years. The country has produced numerous young talents in film, music, design, and gaming, which have gained international recognition. The export value of Indonesia&#8217;s creative sector, including film, music, design, and crafts, has increased in recent years. According to the Creative Economy Agency (Bekraf), the total export value of Indonesia&#8217;s creative industry reached approximately $22 billion in 2019. As of the end of 2022, Indonesia had 2,400 digital startups, most of which are dominated by startups in the creative industry. Web3 and blockchain-based creative industry startups are emerging in Indonesia, for example, Majalabs has spawned Drezzo, a digital fashion startup, and the Noah Project, focused on fine art.The Indonesian government has recognized the importance of the creative industry and has taken steps to support its growth, including providing incentives and funding. Moreover, with a highly active and dynamic startup community, Indonesia displays a high spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship.Preparation Steps:To leverage this potential, several steps need to be taken. First, the enhancement of digital infrastructure is crucial, including improving internet speed, 5G network, and access to advanced technology. Based on research conducted in China, to promote mass adoption of the Metaverse, a minimum of 60% of the population needs to be connected to the Metaverse.Second, education and training, especially in technology, digital arts, and design, need to be improved. It is essential to prepare skilled labor for the creative industry in the Metaverse era.To bolster Indonesia&#8217;s potential in the Metaverse economy, the formal education curriculum at all levels &#8211; from elementary, middle, high school to university &#8211; needs to be revamped to include topics relevant to technology, digital art, and design. Subjects like programming, graphic design, and animation should be a part of this comprehensive curriculum.Further, the power of technology needs to be harnessed to broaden access to education and training, especially for individuals residing in underserved areas. This could be achieved through various digital platforms, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), webinars, or other online learning platforms. By democratizing access to these resources, Indonesia can nurture a skilled workforce ready to contribute to the global Metaverse economy.Third, support for startups and entrepreneurs in technology and creative content fields needs to be increased. This can be done through access to capital and funding. Currently, alternative funding programs for creative industry projects, especially in the music and film industry in Indonesia, have been initiated by the ID-Opentech Group, which brought tokenization and crypto technology from South Korea. The idea is for fans, investors, etc., to support a project with NFT.Fourth, regulations that support innovation and protect intellectual property rights need to be introduced by the government. Lastly, the development of creative communities needs to be encouraged, fostering an ecosystem where developers, designers, and artists can learn and collaborate.Strategic CollaborationsTo optimize this potential, strategic collaborations need to be established. Cooperation between universities and industries can spur innovation and research. Collaborations with international tech companies can accelerate the adoption and development of the metaverse. Partnerships among startups, between the government and private sector, as well as between artists and technologists, are also crucial.The Indonesian government needs to engage global giants such as Microsoft, Meta Group, Apple, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Bytedance, Huawei, and others, to help develop Indonesia&#8217;s creative industry ecosystem.Moreover, regional and international collaborations can assist in developing standards, sharing knowledge and best practices, and hosting joint events and conferences about the metaverse. Indonesia&#8217;s strategic geographic position and neutral foreign policy stance in the power struggle between the West and China could be leveraged to strengthen its bargaining power in developing the local creative economy ecosystem.Bali has great potential to host various international conferences, and the Balinese government has recognized the importance of developing other sources of income besides tourism. They have been embracing the digital economy since 2022, by hosting the Bali Digifest.Majalabs is an excellent example of how a business initiative can bridge the gap between the Bali government, the digital nomad community in Bali, and the local creative industry players in adopting blockchain and web3 technologies, the precursors of the Metaverse.Batam, with its strategic geographical position at the golden triangle facing directly Singapore and Johor in Malaysia, could become the research and innovation hub for Metaverse. Currently, Batam has a digital industry cluster at Nongsa Digital Park, where an animation outsourcing company exists, a primary basis of the Metaverse economy. Batam will also have the world&#8217;s largest data center, serving as a fundamental asset in developing the Metaverse economy.With the right approach and through effective cooperation, Indonesia can leverage its vast potential in the creative industry to become a significant player in the global Metaverse economy. Indeed, it&#8217;s not an easy or quick journey. This will become a solution and an asset for Indonesia to deal with its demographic bonus. The creative industry will absorb a significant amount of the workforce and create jobs.Of course, this is not an easy task, and cooperation between all stakeholders, including the government, industry, and universities, is required to achieve this. Indonesia still has ample time since, according to my research, the mass adoption of the Metaverse will take another 5 to 10 years.U.S. report: One third of Ukraine&#8217;s Bradley vehicles taken outGulf &#8211; Central Asia Summit and the Chinese Belt and Road InitiativeDe-dollarization: IMF hints at allowing countries to use Chinese Yuan for debt repaymentRussia-Africa: Critical Challenges, Refined Practical ApproachOptimistic on US-China RelationsEU referred Falkland Islands as MalvinasRising Ethical States in South Asia: Bangladesh and BhutanRussia-Africa Summit to Focus on Neocolonialism and Global PoliticsCopyright &#169; 2023 Modern Diplomacy</content></entry><entry><title>History of Python programming language</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/history-of-python-programming-language</link><content> Delve into the remarkable evolution of Python, and learn how it grew to become a prominent and beloved programming language in the tech world. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented and high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum. The language&#8217;s design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers.&#160;Python&#8217;s journey began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it has since evolved into one of the most widely used and beloved programming languages across various domains.Van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, started working on Python in December 1989 during his Christmas holidays while working at the Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. His goal was to create a language that would be easy to read, write and maintain. Early in the 1990s, Python continued to be developed, and on February 20, 1991, it had its first public release, version 0.9.0 &#8212; the first time the programming community saw Python. The language design used elements from several other programming languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, and others, to produce a flexible and expressive syntax.Python 2.0, which included several new features and enhancements, was released in 2000. However, as the language developed, some design choices in Python 2 made it more difficult to maintain and advance the language. In response, Python 3 was created and launched on Dec. 3, 2008. With the introduction of backward-incompatible improvements to enhance consistency and eliminate unnecessary functionality, Python 3 represented a substantial advancement.However, Python 3 is not fully backward compatible with Python 2 &#8212; which has reached its end of life and is no longer actively maintained &#8212; requiring some code adjustments when migrating between versions. The most recent stable release of Python 3.10.4, the fourth maintenance release of Python 3.10, was officially published on March 24, 2023.Python&#8217;s popularity has grown over the years due to its readability, adaptability and simplicity of usage. Its clear and simple syntax was well-liked by developers because it simplified writing and understanding code. The availability of a sizable standard library and several third-party packages via the Python Package Index accelerated Python&#8217;s acceptance. These applications include web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scripting, automation and more.Related:&#160;How to learn Python with ChatGPTPython had become one of the most popular programming languages by the 2010s, and its use has only grown since then. Python&#8217;s thriving community and environment were boosted by the adoption of the language by several IT businesses, startups, and organizations for their projects.Van Rossum named Python in honor of the British comic troupe Monty Python&#8217;s Flying Circus, who he was a fan of.Despite its humorous beginnings, Python has developed into a serious and important programming language that powers important projects and systems all around the world. However, the amusing association with Monty Python has remained a charming feature of Python&#8217;s past.Related:&#160;7 most in-demand programming languages to learnPython is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used for a variety of purposes. However, there are several circumstances where it might not be the best option. Some examples are real-time systems, resource-intensive software, mobile app development, high-frequency trading, system-level programming, memory-intensive software, mobile or console gaming, and certain cryptographic algorithms.Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that using the correct libraries and tools can frequently help overcome Python&#8217;s restrictions. The choice of programming language ultimately depends on the project&#8217;s needs, the team&#8217;s experience and the development goals. Python is still a well-liked and helpful language that can be used alone or in combination with other languages to accomplish many tasks.

Increase In Price</title><link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/elon-musk-incorporates-dogecoin-symbol/</link><content>Elon Musk is, once again, showing his support for Dogecoin in a subtle but meaningful way. Twitter, one of the biggest social media companies now under the leadership of Musk, recently changed its logo from the infamous &#8216;blue bird&#8217; to a seemingly discrete X symbol. However, this was not the end of the changes as Musk also changed his Twitter bio to display the Dogecoin symbol.&#160;On Monday, Elon Musk changed his Twitter location to &#8220;X&#208;&#8221;, X for the new Twitter logo, and &#208; for Dogecoin&#8217;s logo, sparking speculations about a possible integration of Dogecoin into the Twitter platform.This isn&#8217;t the first time Musk has promoted DOGE and caused a stir in the crypto community, as he has tweeted about the meme coin several times in the past. With almost 150 million followers on the social media platform, Musk&#8217;s tweets garner a huge amount of attention. So when he mentions specific companies or cryptocurrencies, it often leads to big price swings.&#160;His tweets in the past have triggered double-digit percentage increases in the price of Dogecoin in particular. This time, Musk&#8217;s support seems to have had more of a subtle price reaction.&#160;Following the implementation of the new bio, the price of Dogecoin shot up more than 5%. Trading volume on exchanges also increased drastically as investors rushed to buy the altcoin. According to Coinmarketcap, Dogecoin has seen a total increase of 309.19% in trading volume in the past 24 hours.&#160;Dogecoin was created as a &#8220;meme currency,&#8221; but has since developed its own very passionate community and following, including Elon Musk, who is one of the world&#8217;s richest men.There&#8217;s a good chance that Twitter (now X) may incorporate Dogecoin payments into its platform, especially given Musk&#8217;s continuous support. As Twitter&#8217;s largest shareholder, Musk could push for the social media company to incorporate the meme coin into its ecosystem. This will enable users to seamlessly make payments on the site using Dogecoin, which may attract more crypto investors to the platform and boost user engagement.However, there are a few roadblocks in the way. More stable cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum are starting to be accepted as payment methods in various aspects of the world. However, altcoins like Dogecoin are still very volatile with little utility and there are questions about its stability before Twitter (X) seriously considers it as an official payment method.At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.07535, a quick increase from its price of $0.07081 earlier in the day.

Worldcoin (WLD), the native token of the &#8220;privacy-preserving digital identity (World ID)&#8221; project founded by OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, soared after listing on major crypto exchanges on July 24.&#160;At the time of writing, WLD trades at $2.22, reflecting a 33% gain on the day. Despite criticism from nearly every corner of the crypto sector, WLD&#8217;s one-day performance eclipses that of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and the remainder of the crypto market, which has sold off&#160;throughout the day. For many traders, one area of concern is WLD&#8217;s circulating supply versus its supply cap. With only 1% of the total supply currently in circulation, Worldcoin has a fully diluted market capitalization that exceeds $22 billion. Worldcoin taking a page out of SBF Solana eco playbook, launching and pumping a microcap shitcoin with 1% of total supply in circulation. $22.8 billion fully diluted market cap. lol, lmao even pic.twitter.com/xtN8P4SFijRelated: Worldcoin token launch sparks response from Vitalik ButerinThe token launch entailed 143 million WLD being issued. Notably, 100 million WLD were allocated to market markers, with the remaining tokens being received by investors who verified by scanning their iris during Worldcoin&#8217;s pre-launch process.

Creds give users a secure and private way to prove their identity in Web3 environments. What&#8217;s more, they&#8217;re fully portable and reusable, allowing users to slowly build up a strong reputation without ever revealing their true identity.&#160;Cheqd explains that there are many challenges around the issue of Web3 security, with crypto scams wiping out millions of dollars in user&#8217;s funds, creating massive distrust in online communities.&#160;According to cheqd, the best way to combat Web3 scams is to increase the trust and reputation of users, which is exactly what it&#8217;s aiming to do with Creds. It provides a way for individuals to confirm their personhood and ownership of assets such as wallets and user handles across multiple platforms. So a moderator on a Discord server could prove their status and role, without revealing their identity. A scammer would not be able to prove this. In this way, not only will Creds help to prevent scams, but they can also prevent impersonation-based attacks and the spread of fake news by malicious individuals.&#160;Cheqd&#8217;s idea with Creds is that users can build a verifiable reputation across multiple platforms and communities, with full control over which credentials they decide to share with which groups.&#160;Of course, a decentralized identity does more than simply improve security and prevent fraud. One of the most promising aspects of Creds is its ability to enable new kinds of gamified engagement for communities. By creating a reputation layer, projects can explore new gamification mechanics such as incentivized quests or &#8220;learn-to-earn&#8221; courses, where users are rewarded for learning and participating in forums and community activities.&#160;Cheqd&#8217;s Head of Marketing &amp; Community Eduardo Hotta said Web3 organizations are very interested in becoming more community-focused. &#8220;As an example, it's preferable to have a smaller number of real active community members, or superfans, than to have a group with thousands of bots,&#8221; he said. With Creds, projects can prove they have viable, active and engaged communities and encourage people to build reputations within them.&#160;Cheqd notes that similar decentralized identity projects in the past have made use of NFTs and SoulBound Tokens with varying levels of success. Creds differ from previous initiatives because these tokens are completely private, revocable and portable, able to be used with multiple platforms and ecosystems. With Creds, all personally identifiable information is stored off-chain, privately and securely. This data is verified by decentralized identifiers on-chain and cryptographically signed to ensure trust.&#160;Creds are set to become a key aspect of cheqd&#8217;s mission to build a trusted data economy based on lending markets, preference data markets and others that put users at the center. Cheqd supports these markets with a cutting-edge payment network that prioritizes individual&#8217;s privacy.&#160;"Creds offers a privacy-preserving alternative to the surveillance enabling tech of SBTs and NFTs where you have little control over your privacy, as activities and other information are written on the ledger making it public and immutable,&#8221; said cheqd co-founder and Chief Executive Fraser Edwards. &#8220;Creds are collectable, portable, secure and verifiable; it has all the best things that the NFT and SBT have with the addition of everything else they are missing."At Nebular Summit, all attendees were issued with Creds, enabling them to verifiably prove their attendance at the event without revealing their identities or any other information about themselves.&#160;Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Each boxer NFT must be paired with an "AI Brain" NFT to determine their behavior.Meanwhile, the recent funding comes amid growing skepticism toward the concept of the metaverse, which was all the hype over the past few years.&#160;However, Ripple Labs President Monica Long said she still believes in Futureverse&#8217;s vision.&#8220;While we&#8217;re at the earliest stages of what a project like this&#8212;and really the larger concept of the metaverse&#8212;can achieve, we at Ripple are thrilled to contribute to the foundational infrastructure layer and provide real utility to the end users of the open metaverse,&#8221; Long said in a statement.The metaverse has been a topic of intense debate in the tech world, particularly since many big supporters of the idea have recently backed down from their ambitions.&#160;Earlier this year, entertainment giant Disney&#160;announced&#160;that it is eliminating its metaverse division as part of broader layoffs that will impact as many as 7,000 employees.Moreover,&#160;Microsoft&#160;has&#160;discontinued&#160;its&#160;Industrial Metaverse Core&#160;team this year, a four-month-old project aimed to encourage the use of the metaverse in industrial environments.&#160; A quick 3min read about today's crypto news!

Pretty much every aspect of LeBron James' life has changed since his days as "The Kid From Akron," the Ohio city where he was raised by a single teenaged mother, Gloria James. The one big exception is his love life. LeBron has been with Savannah James (n&#233;e Brinson) since they were teenagers. Savannah played softball and was part of the cheerleading squad when she met the basketball-slash-football player from another high school in 2001.By then, LeBron was already the talk of the town. "He just finished his sophomore season, and yet he might just be the best high school basketball player in America,"&#160;Slam magazine's Ryan Jones wrote that same year. While she knew the extent of his talent, Savannah couldn't have imagined where life next to LeBron would take her.&#160;"We were two kids who started dating, as any two high-school kids would. Believe it or not, I didn't know that he was going to be what he is today," she told The Cut for its May-June issue.LeBron and Savannah were together for 12 years before tying the knot in September 2013. At that point, they already shared two sons, LeBron "Bronny" Jr. and Bryce, born in 2004 and 2007. LeBron and Savannah's daughter, Zhuri, completed the family in October 2014. One of the&#160;most accomplished athletes&#160;in sports history, LeBron has the&#160;bank account to show for it. But that doesn't mean Savannah just sat around waiting for her husband to bring in the dollars.&#160;
While Savannah James has dedicated most of her time to supporting LeBron James' career and raising their children, she also found time to pursue her own interests. Throughout the years, Savannah has been involved in different business ventures. In 2010, she and LeBron launched a youth furniture collection in partnership with Ohio's&#160;American Signature Inc., according to&#160;WOIO. But she branched out on her own, too.In 2013, Savannah opened The Juice Spot in Miami. "I would listen to him talk about his conversations with Warren Buffett or Jerry Jones," she told ESPN. "But I wanted to get into business, too."&#160;She had to close it in 2016 because she was having a hard time managing from afar following LeBron's departure from Miami Heat, the Miami Herald noted.&#160;But she was far from done.&#160;In 2018, Savannah co-launched K+ Organics, a brand of sports drinks for children. "In this day and age, there are so many more healthy alternatives for adults than we had ... growing up, but it's frustrating to still not see healthier options for kids," she told Forbes.Savannah also has stakes in Lobos Tequila, Lockerverse, a Web3 startup, and NEZ, a natural deodorant company, she told The Cut. That's not all. Savannah is working on several projects that she's pretty proud of. "Definitely have some passion projects I'm working on ...&#160;And I'm super-excited about them. I think they're going to be amazing. They're going to be well received," she said.
LeBron James was at the height of fame at the time the wives of athletes were all the rage. In 2015, just a couple of years after LeBron won two back-to-back NBA championships&#160;with the Heat and was about to win another with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016,&#160;E! released the reality show "WAGS," which focused on the lives of players' significant others. But Savannah James never jumped on that bandwagon.&#160;"I just really wanted to enjoy being a mom and supporting my husband. I wasn't super-comfortable with putting myself out like that," she told The Cut.While LeBron's professional life was on spotlight, his wife opted to stay out of it entirely. "That time, to be honest, was spent pouring into my boys," she explained. After raising two sons, Savannah got to relive some of the experiences she had with her own mom with Zhuri, many of which revolved around doing their hair. "It was a true bonding time that we had, and a time for her to instill confidence in me, tell me that my hair is beautiful, and embrace my curls"&#160;she told Vogue in March.Savannah believed that raising her and LeBron's&#160;children to become quality humans outweighed profiting off of her connection to the NBA superstar. "The best thing about being a mom is definitely seeing the things that you're teaching them and the values you're instilling in them come out of them," she told&#160;WKYC.&#160;These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners.

Den Investoren l&#228;uft die Zeit davon, um sich an einem der vielversprechendsten aufstrebenden Metaverse-Presales der Web3-Branche zu beteiligen. DeeLance baut ein innovatives, krypto- und NFT-gest&#252;tztes Metaverse auf, das Freelancer und Arbeitgeber zusammenbringt und als potenzieller Gamechanger f&#252;r die Remote-Working-Branche angepriesen wird.In der Tat verspricht das Projekt, die Remote-Arbeit f&#252;r immer zu ver&#228;ndern, ebenso wie den 761 Milliarden Dollar schweren Sektor der Personalvermittlung. DeeLance konnte durch den Verkauf seines nativen Tokens $DLANCE knappe 1,6 Millionen Dollar einnehmen.Der Vorverkauf wird jedoch in etwas mehr als 9 Tagen enden. Danach wird die einzige M&#246;glichkeit, $DLANCE-Token zu kaufen, &#252;ber zentrale oder dezentrale Kryptow&#228;hrungsb&#246;rsen zu einem erh&#246;hten Preis sein.In der Tat plant $DLANCE, den Token sp&#228;ter im Jahr an den gro&#223;en B&#246;rsen f&#252;r 0,057 $ zu notieren, fast 20 % &#252;ber dem aktuellen Vorverkaufspreis von 0,048 Dollar. Potenzielle Investoren sollten auch beachten, dass DeeLance einen massiven 100.000 Dollar $DLANCE Token-Giveaway-Wettbewerb durchf&#252;hrt.Vier gl&#252;ckliche Investoren, die mindestens 100 Dollar an $DLANCE-Token besitzen, m&#252;ssen elf Aufgaben erf&#252;llen, darunter das Folgen der verschiedenen Social-Media-Plattformen von DeeLance, um sich zu qualifizieren.Jetzt DeeLance-Website besuchen.Mithilfe der Dezentralisierung und Transparenz der Blockchain will DeeLance allzu m&#228;chtige Zwischenh&#228;ndler wie Fiverr und Upwork ausschalten, die im letzten Jahrzehnt Freelancer und Arbeitgeber gleicherma&#223;en schlecht behandelt haben.Das Metaverse von DeeLance kann als ein Blockchain-getriebener, auf Arbeit fokussierter digitaler Raum betrachtet werden, der sowohl Freelancern als auch Arbeitgebern mit niedrigeren Geb&#252;hren als die bestehenden gro&#223;en Web2-Freelancer-Websites helfen soll.Das Herzst&#252;ck des DeeLance-Ansatzes ist die Tokenisierung von digitalen Arbeiten der Freelancer in NFTs, die die sichere und zuverl&#228;ssige &#220;bertragung des Eigentums an der Arbeit erleichtert.Dies ist eine direkte Antwort auf die seit langem bestehenden Herausforderungen im Bereich der digitalen Freiberuflichkeit, wie z. B. Urheberrechtsverletzungen und Zahlungsbetrug, und bietet allen Beteiligten ein noch nie dagewesenes Ma&#223; an Sicherheit und Gewissheit.Im Gegensatz zu vielen existierenden Freelance-Plattformen, bei denen es schwierig sein kann, sich anzumelden und die einen gro&#223;en Teil des Verdienstes eines Freelancers einbehalten, ist DeeLance leicht zug&#228;nglich und bietet &#228;u&#223;erst niedrige Geb&#252;hren.Um sich bei DeeLance anzumelden, sind keine Browser-Plugins, Apps von Drittanbietern oder sogar Kreditkartendaten erforderlich. Die Zahlungen erfolgen schnell und mit Kryptow&#228;hrungen, und dank der Blockchain ist alles transparent und sicher, wobei die Zahlungen &#252;ber ein Treuhandsystem und Smart Contracts gesichert sind.Hier mehr &#252;ber DeeLance erfahren.Die Begeisterung f&#252;r das DeeLance-Projekt auf allen Social-Media-Plattformen hat in den letzten Wochen stetig zugenommen, da immer mehr Menschen von den Pl&#228;nen und der Vision des Projekts erfahren, freiberufliche und Remote-Arbeit zu transformieren. Der offizielle Twitter-Account des Projekts erreichte k&#252;rzlich 40.000 Follower.Inzwischen sind die Kan&#228;le auf Telegram und Discord auf jeweils &#252;ber 72.000 bzw. 10.000 Mitglieder angewachsen. Mittlerweile z&#228;hlen verschiedene seri&#246;se Nachrichten- und Analyse-Websites wie Cryptonews.com, Business 2 Community, InsideBitcoins, Techopedia, Cryptopresales.com und Analytics Insight DeeLance zu den vielversprechendsten Krypto-Presales-Projekten des Jahres 2023.Und andere Medienpartnerschaften bedeuten, dass das Web3-Startup auch auf anderen gro&#223;en Krypto-Nachrichten-Websites wie Be[In]Crypto und CoinTelegraph sowie auf traditionellen Nachrichten-Websites wie Yahoo! Finance und Business Insider prominent vertreten ist.&#160;Das Team hat auch erhebliche Anstrengungen unternommen, um verschiedene Krypto-Communitys zu erreichen, und veranstaltete mehrere Ask Me Anything (AMA)-Sitzungen zu Themen wie Hulks, Gems Calls, Coinsniper, ICO Speakers, BSC News, Binance Live und Whale Coin Talk.Da sich die Nachricht verbreitet und die DeeLance-Community schnell w&#228;chst, ist es kein Wunder, dass Kryptoanalysten f&#252;r das kommende Jahr gro&#223;e Gewinne f&#252;r $DLANCE vermuten.Der beliebte britische Krypto-Vorverkaufsanalyst Jacob Crypto Bury glaubt, dass DeeLance &#8222;riesiges Potenzial&#8220; hat, w&#228;hrend sein Kollege Crypto Gains glaubt, dass $DLANCE leicht das Potenzial haben k&#246;nnte, um das 20-fache anzusteigen.DeeLance wurde von SolidProof und Coinsuls gepr&#252;ft und zertifiziert, um sicherzustellen, dass es SAFU ist und das Team KYC-zertifiziert ist. DeeLance hat sich au&#223;erdem eine Pre-ICO-Notierung auf CoinMarketCap gesichert.Jetzt $DLANCE im Presale kaufen.&#160;Hinweis: Investieren ist spekulativ. Bei der Anlage ist Ihr Kapital in Gefahr.

After a significant recovery from support at $0.46, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) currency is aiming at a breakout to reach $0.80.In the past month, BitDAO&#8217;s (BIT) price has gained by over 35%, and the current bull market continues to show strength.Following the partnership between Mantle Network, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, and BitDAO a month ago, the price of BIT surged. This merger united BitDAO&#8217;s governance structure and financial capabilities with Mantle Network&#8217;s advanced technology.Furthermore, the BitDAO community also enhanced the merger&#8217;s approval by casting their votes to favor the BIP-21 DAO governance proposal.During the organization&#8217;s governance forum in 2023, the Mantle Core group proposed that BitDAO (BIT) sets up a fund to assist startup Web3 firms.Notably, the fund&#8217;s recommended investment period is three years, and an extra extension period of two years.Interestingly, BitDAO currently holds about 78% of its treasury in the DAO&#8217;s token (BIT), making it one of the crypto market&#8217;s biggest DAO treasuries, valued at around $3.7 billion.Nonetheless, BitDAO investments have varied and its focus now is to bring all of the ecosystem&#8217;s investments under one consistent brand.These developments in BitDAO&#8217;s (BIT) platform and community appear to have increased demand for tokens and helped fuel its recent rally.In that context, the Fear &amp; Greed Index shows a neutral score of 50. On the other hand, technical indicators show a bullish market mood on BitDAO (BIT), meaning that it is poised for a bullish outbreak.VC Spectra (SPCT), operating as a decentralized hedge fund, utilizes a precise selection process to pinpoint promising opportunities.

</content></entry><entry><title>We gave ChatGPT $20,000 to invest and this is how it spent it</title><link>https://www.newsbtc.com/research/we-gave-chatgpt-20000-to-invest-and-this-is-how-it-spent-it/</link><content>2023 has seen the rise of AI, with programs such as Bard and ChatGPT offering answers to any and all queries, ranging from what the weather is to writing college essays. We all know AI is based on machine learning, but how much can we trust the advice it gives? We wanted to find out if we can trust these programs, so we gave ChatGPT a budget of $10k to invest in stocks and $10k to invest in cryptocurrencies, subsequently following the advice provided.&#160;Before following this advice, it is worth noting ChatGPT states the information given is not financial advice, and consulting with a financial advisor is always recommended. ChatGPT also suggests doing your own research to make more informed decisions regarding which stocks are worth investing in.The program provides further advice for cryptocurrencies, stressing the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the importance of considering your financial situation when making investment decisions. Regularly reviewing your portfolio based on market conditions and investment performance is also advised.It took a little bit of training, but we eventually got ChatGPT to suggest exactly how much of my budget to invest in each stock/ coin, the breakdown is as follows:&#160;10%$100010%$10009%$9009%$9008%$8007%$7007%$7004%$4004%$4004%$4004%$4003%$3003%$3003%$3003%$3002%$2002%$2002%$2002%$2001%$1001%$1001%$1001%$10020%$200020%$200010%$100010%$100010%$100010%$100010%$100010%$1000The suggested stocks are rather expected; higher investments in stable stocks and a lower investment into stocks with more fluctuations. The cryptocurrency investments are slightly more interesting, however, as, of the 1000+ coins currently on the market, it&#8217;s given me a short list of eight to invest in.&#160;&#160;The experiment started off on unsteady legs with stocks ending with a profit of $159 and cryptocurrencies making a loss of $64 after the first day. Five of the eight cryptocurrencies invested in made a loss, with Binance Coin performing the worst, with our $956 investment suffering a $44 decrease.Stocks increased throughout the week but decreased right at the end ($25 lower compared to the previous day), making the final weekly total $10,220. This is a $220 increase from the initial investment, a solid start for our experiment.Our crypto investment did not perform nearly as well in the first week, with only three&#160; days ending in a profit from the initial $10k investment. The fourth day was the worst of our whole experiment, with an ending total of $9,741. Only two of the coins invested turned a profit on that day, with Ethereum making a loss of $114 from the initial investment. Our week ended on a slightly more positive note with a final total of $10,021, a $21 increase from the initial investment.&#160;During the second week,&#160; the total reached $10,643 by the end of the second day. This is $423 more than the total at the end of week one. However, this high was short-lived as the final value decreased for the remainder of the week, ending on $10,492. Whilst $272 more than the final value of the first week, it&#8217;s $151 less than the second day&#8217;s total.After a shaky beginning, our cryptocurrency investment far outperformed our stocks investment in the second week, peaking at $11,118 on the fourth day. This then decreased on the fifth and final day, making the final value of the week $10,987, a $967 increase from the first week.&#160;The start of the third week saw more decreases for our stocks investments. Nine of our 23 investments decreased on the second and third day. The latter half of the week performed better, increasing to $10,559 in total by the final day.Our cryptocurrency investment performed similarly, with a decrease at the start of the week and an increase towards the end. The final value dropped to $10,609 on the fourth day, then increased dramatically to $10,974 by the end of the fifth. The final value of the week was $11,402, a $415 increase from week two.&#160;The final week of our stock investments was a disappointment with the overall value decreasing slightly for a final figure of $10,587. This is an overall increase of $587 from our initial investment, which is an overall ROI of 6%.On the first day of the final week, our crypto investments increased by $314 to $11,719 in total, this is the highest end of day total we reached in our experiment. This was the high point, however, as we decreased throughout the rest of the week, ending with a final total of $11,359, a 14% ROI.&#160;Whilst we ended up turning a profit from our stock investments, there were ten investments which made a loss from the initial investment, almost 45% of investments made. The worst-performing stock was Pfizer inc. which decreased from the third week and ended up with an ROI of -10%. This was after the company announced they were discontinuing the development of the type 2 diabetes and obesity candidate lotiglipron over safety concerns.&#160;Rivian proved the best-performing stock, with an ROI of 88%, initially priced at $14.03 per stock it increased to $25.51 over the month. This is after the company announced that Q2 2023 was the best financial quarter in the company&#8217;s history.&#160;On the other hand, we had much more luck with our crypto investments, with only one of the investments returning a loss, making up 13% of the initial investment. This was Ripple (XRP), there are several reasons for this, one being that the transaction volume of XRP is down 90%.The coin with the highest ROI is Solana (SOL) with an ROI of 39%, which is a $389 increase. SOL is considered a relatively stable coin with strong community backing, making it a good coin to invest in.Whilst it&#8217;s possible Bitcoin was suggested as one of the largest investments because it&#8217;s the biggest cryptocurrency. It was actually a great crypto to invest in as the price went from $26k to $30k, this was due to news that a new, safer, crypto exchange launched, receiving investments from Invesco and WisdomTree.There is one stock we feel could have been missed from ChatGPT&#8217;s suggestions, this is Meta, the company who owns Facebook and Instagram. They&#8217;ve recently released a new app as part of Instagram called Threads, a Twitter competitor. It was released at the perfect time, after news that Twitter was limiting the number of Tweets its users could see.&#160;This isn&#8217;t one of the stocks ChatGPT suggested investing in, so we wanted to see what could have happened had ChatGPT suggested investing in META stocks. Using historical data for the last month, we calculated that if we had invested $1,000, we would have $1,100 by the end of the experiment. This is more than we earned from the $1,000 we invested in Amazon and Apple stocks.We started by asking ChatGPT for stock market opportunities. Initially, it gave a generic answer of the types of industries which should be invested in and why. From these industries, we asked it to recommend specific companies from each. We then sent the list of all the suggested stocks back to it and asked for a weighting of a $10k investment.We found that one of the stocks suggested, Waymo, is not a publicly traded business, we had to go back to ChatGPT and ask for it to remove this stock and add a new one. It was replaced by Johnson Controls International plc.It was a much easier process to get answers about which cryptocurrencies to invest in. As ChatGPT gave us an initial list of coins, and when asked how much to invest in each it gave a general strategy for investing in cryptocurrency. 40-50% should come from Bitcoin and Ethereum combined and 10-20% for each of the remaining coins. We decided to put 20% into Bitcoin, 20% into Ethereum and 10% for the remaining coins.

Arianna Simpson is a general partner deploying capital for a16z&#8217;s multi-billion-dollar crypto fund(s).

After this day, your funds will be automatically converted to USDT,&#8221; the company said in the statement.For Nigerian users, they can withdraw it through Cashlink into their bank account or withdraw their funds into their chosen bank account through P2P express.For Ghanaian users, the company said they can withdraw all their money and Cedis to USDT and transfer to any other wallet.It also set specific requirements for those in Francophone Africa as well as Kenya.Bundle&#8217;s cessation of operations comes at a time the African crypto industry has taken a beating. Nestcoin, a Nigerian crypto startup, which held investor funds in collapsed FTX, had to&#160;lay off staff&#160;last year. In February, another Nigerian crypto startup, Fluidcoins, was&#160;acquired by Bitfinex&#160;after it unsuccessfully tried to raise funds to continue its business operations. In April, Lazerpay, a web3 and crypto payment company,&#160;shut down, months after the startup&#8217;s founder, Njoku Emmanuel, shared that the company was having trouble raising funds.&#160;

The backstory is that Web3 influencer Thread Guy vied for a spot on the Ape Council but lost the election. In response, Twitter user @BoredOpepen offered to trade one of his rare Opepen NFTs for Thread Guy&#8217;s iconic Mutant Ape. This led to a flurry of other trade offers, including one from Pudgy Penguin CEO Luca Netz with a $1 million guarantee.The winner however, was visualizevalue.eth aka Jack Butcher, who created an open mint for a specially created Opepen NFT inspired by Thread Guy&#8217;s Ape, with all proceeds going directly to Thread Guy. Crypto Twitter loved it, and countless interpretations were shared, each declaring &#8220;For the culture.&#8221;How: The open edition can be minted for .001 ETH on Zora, roughly two bucks. As of writing, over 50,000 have been minted.Doodles goes to Camp: Are you ready to &#8220;get sucked into a magical glowing portal&#8221; to an immersive Doodles land?

SBF gets animated: The FTX saga is getting an animated comedy series starring T.J. Miller as Sam Bankman-Fried. The series, called &#8220;FORTUN3,&#8221; will favor the bold choices of those who buy the associated NFTs.What Is ActivityPub? On July 6, Meta released their Twitter-alternative, Threads, and it&#8217;s already handily passed 100 million downloads. One of the interesting promises of the new app is that it will support ActivityPub, a decentralized social media protocol, which means users will be able to interact with other platforms in the so-called fediverse like Mastodon and vice versa.Story continues belowSo what is the ActivityPub Protocol and what is the fediverse?

Google Cloud is aggressively expanding its presence in the Web3 space which signals growing mainstream adoption of crypto and validates it as a lucrative new market.Google Cloud, the cloud computing services division of tech giant Google, is steadily rolling out more products and services aimed at dominating the fast-evolving Web3 and cryptocurrency markets. This follows the recent launch of a startup support program focused on the Web3 segment.According to James Tromans, head of Google Cloud Web3, the company will continue building services like its Blockchain Node Engine. The goal is to help customers "become transformational players in the Web3 ecosystem" which is now a core part of Google Cloud's mission.While no specific new initiatives were revealed, Tromans said Google Cloud will keep offering blockchain datasets and other fundamental capabilities to help crypto startups move faster. The company is already working with financial services and gaming firms to explore how Web3 can improve operations and open new revenue streams.Google Cloud is also bullish on artificial intelligence and its potential use cases within crypto businesses. Tromans stated that "AI is key to solving business and technology challenges so we're exploring use cases where AI and large language models can be uniquely applied in the Web3 space."Google's new focus on crypto and Web3 is a notable shift for the tech giant. In January 2022, Google formed a dedicated blockchain division to work on distributed ledger technology.Last October, the cloud unit launched its Blockchain Node Engine to assist Web3 developers building on blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana. And in April 2022, Google Cloud introduced a Web3 startup support program offering grants, free access to Google's infrastructure, and technical help.Through this program, Google Cloud is collaborating with Aptos, Celo, Flow, HBAR Foundation, Near Protocol, and the Solana Foundation. Each partner pledged $1 million in grants for selected Web3 startups.While Google has not revealed specific startups in the program, Web3 firm Cosmic Wire announced it was chosen for assistance. The interoperable blockchain specialist raised $30 million in a seed round led by Solana Foundation and Polygon.For many Web3 founders, Google's pivot into crypto validates it as a major new market. Alireza Ghods, CEO of privacy-focused computer vision startup Natix, said he hopes Google will accept Natix into the startup program.Ghods also pointed to Google Play easing restrictions for blockchain apps this month as further evidence of the company embracing crypto. With over 3 billion Android users, Google is wise to support Web3 projects and charge fees rather than blocking them outright.Google's startup program and app policy changes follow the launch of the Solana Saga phone in April 2022. Solana Mobile aims to create an open and decentralized app ecosystem for Android to rival Google Play.According to Ghods, "Solana Mobile and other initiatives to democratize Android likely contributed to Google's decision to welcome Web3."Overall, the warming reception to crypto by Google and other tech giants signals growing mainstream adoption. As cryptocurrencies become more popular and regulated, companies like Google want to tap into a new revenue stream.At the same time, the integration of Web3 into existing tech platforms lends further legitimacy to the space. The more giants like Google get involved, the more crypto becomes normalized for billions of everyday users.While Google's embracing of crypto is mostly positive, the company must avoid stifling innovation or over-centralizing Web3 networks. Google dominates online advertising, search, mobile operating systems and more.The company's vast power and influence could be dangerous if improperly applied to cryptocurrencies. Google must collaborate closely with developers to enhance the core values of decentralization, transparency and fairness.There is also the persisting issue of crypto scams on Google's platforms. Google Play and YouTube have long struggled with fake crypto apps, videos and advertisements defrauding users. Google must quadruple efforts to purge scammers and bad actors from its ecosystem.The arrival of tech titans like Google into the crypto space is a double-edged sword. On one side, it validates cryptocurrencies and helps drive mainstream adoption. But on the other side, companies like Google must be careful not to dominate Web3 like they have the internet. Crypto should enhance freedom and opportunity for all - not further enrich and empower existing giants.Google Cloud can foster a thriving Web3 ecosystem by taking a hands-off, collaborative approach. The company should focus on providing tools and infrastructure that empower developers, not imposing its own agenda.Some key ways Google can assist Web3 growth without hindering it include:Most importantly, Google should see itself as an enabler - not a controller - of innovation. Staying humble and recognizing it does not have all the answers will go a long way.Trust is crucial for any financial system, especially cryptographic ones. Some best practices crypto firms should adopt include:Ultimately, crypto companies need to balance privacy with transparency. Users have a right to understand how platforms work and how their assets are secured. More transparency, starting from project inception, is still the best remedy against scams.Our media partner: </content></entry><entry><title>Web3 Utility Coin LPX Secures $1.1 Million in Funding for Its ...</title><link>https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-utility-coin-lpx-secures-11-million-funding-for-its-new-trading-alpha-platform-heres-what-you-need-know.htm</link><content>The cryptocurrency market is chock-full of contenders competing for attention beyond the shadow of Bitcoin.

Utility coin LPX, associated with the blockchain startup Launchpad XYZ, has raised $1.17 million in its presale, leading the pack in the functional crypto race.Differing from its counterparts, the utility coin LPX is not a mere object of speculation.

The user-friendly tool will assist consumers in consistently deriving value from the unpredictable and volatile crypto market.The utility coin $LPX plays a pivotal role in accessing premium features.

LPX will also be required for transaction fees when investing in fractional assets.Launchpad XYZ, through its planned features, seeks to democratize high-value investments. Investors could potentially gain fractional ownership of a luxury car or prime real estate through the platform.The platform's proprietary tool, Launchpad Quotient, will help users analyze the crypto market efficiently. The risk-reward score generated by this tool will be derived from over 400 data points via artificial intelligence (AI).Launchpad XYZ's investment strategy and its use of AI sets it apart from other crypto presales. Users can interact with the platform's AI to get a list of potential crypto investments. They can then share these AI-generated suggestions on social media.Another unique feature of this platform is the NFT mint whitelisting. Launchpad XYZ plans to secure an allocation of whitelisting spots for new NFT collections for its users. Coupled with an NFT screener, this feature will assist users in finding suitable NFTs for their portfolios, including key metrics like pricing, demand, and future potential.The platform's decentralized exchange will facilitate trading in crypto pairs and NFTs. The DEX will operate with a maker-taker commission structure and will support various order types. Users staking LPX tokens will benefit from reduced trading commissions.Another unique offering of Launchpad XYZ is its play-to-earn gaming hub. Users can view all play-to-earn games in the market on a single platform and even wager on the outcomes of these games. Those staking LPX tokens will have access to new game releases ahead of the general public.Launchpad XYZ plans to offer access to private ICOs as one of its premium features as well. It will secure an allocation of tokens for premium users, with the only requirement being the staking of at least 10,000 LPX tokens. Private ICO rounds offer access to the lowest possible cost price, which is usually unavailable to casual investors due to high minimum investment requirements.In short, with its user-friendly dashboard, range of features, and the central role of its utility coin LPX, Launchpad XYZ is one to watch in the realm of Web 3.0 investments.

The investment round was led by prominent investors Solana Foundation and Polygon, positioning Cosmic Wire as the first-ever cross-chain funded Web3 company.The company intends to use the funding to accelerate the development of a decentralized, transparent and secure digital Web3 ecosystem. It plans to expand its Web3 ecosystem through cross-chain technology, facilitating data transfer and interoperability across diverse blockchains.The company said its primary objective is to give users complete control over their Web3 data and online interactions, fostering trust and individual sovereignty.&#8220;As a startup, we focused entirely on our vision and building working prototype systems that were sorely missing in Web3 and what we considered to be natively necessary for mass adoption,&#8221; Jerad Finck, CEO and founder of Cosmic Wire, told VentureBeat. &#8220;This investment will allow us to scale and deliver our products and technology ready for mass adoption.&#8221;VB Transform 2023 On-DemandDid you miss a session from VB Transform 2023?

Instead, the company embraces a decentralized approach through cross-chain technology, ensuring interoperability and security &#8220;in a true zero-trust environment with no backdoor access, and transparent as all data usage is containerized and time-stamped on the chain. It is, simply put, algorithmic systems built to stabilize and scale with transparency, security and accuracy,&#8221; said Finck. &#8220;The chain is the internet; the people are the nodes.&#8221;The company is constructing its Web3 infrastructure on the Solana network. It asserts that its metaverse SDK solutions substantially decrease development time for high-fidelity, 3D, browser-based metaverse experiences. These solutions also integrate ecommerce, digital products, content CDNs, payment methods and avatar user-generated content (UGC).Finck emphasized that at its core, blockchain functions as an immutable ledger. &#8220;We have placed all processes on the chain, including commodity trades, tokenized access, API connections and basic system functions. These processes are driven by an access layer of soul-bound identity, which creates localized ecosystems capable of algorithmically scaling existing and proven processes,&#8221; Finck explained to VentureBeat.He clarified that his company does not radically alter the foundation of operations. Instead, it focuses on leveraging existing systems more effectively and efficiently. He asserts that the company&#8217;s cross-chain technology can benefit every Web2 or preexisting system, as it centers on the core values of accuracy, security and transparency in these functions.The company secured a significant seed round, even amid a challenging market, with leading entities as key investors. Its toolkit has already been licensed into global infrastructure for widespread adoption.&#8220;We aim to revolutionize business practices, communication methods and asset protection, providing users with true ownership rather than mere user status. The entire cross-chain software ecosystem we&#8217;ve developed revolves around these core principles,&#8221; Finck said.He highlighted that users will experience a fundamental shift in the cross-chain system, evolving from mere users to empowered owners. Individual ownership is empowered through a global mesh network, enabling trustless interactions within a fully algorithmic and transparent approach, facilitating streamlined and scaled connections.In addition to the funding milestone, Cosmic Wire has secured participation in Google Cloud&#8217;s eagerly awaited Web3 startup program, even before its official launch. Through this program, the company will gain exclusive access to customized resources, including a substantial allocation of Google Cloud credits for two years, unprecedented entry into Google&#8217;s Web3 ecosystem and a range of complimentary benefits.&#8220;We did not build into verticals; we built an ecosystem that can be applied virtually anywhere,&#8221; said Finck. &#8220;We are already in fields from military development to finance, medical to education, entertainment to fantasy; it is not about the genre but about how the tool can be used and implemented to new degrees of extrapolation and efficacy that have not been achieved until now.&#8221;VentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.
